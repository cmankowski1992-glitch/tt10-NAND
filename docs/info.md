## How it works

The NAND gate works by first performing the AND logic and then performing the NOT logic. This code works by taking 2 of the 8 input pins, creating a wire to perform the AND function and then creating another wire to perform the NOT function. This output is pushed to the output pin.

## How to test

NAND Truth Table
Inputs | Output
A B | Y
0 0  1
0 1  1
1 0  1
1 1  0
